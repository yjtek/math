    "Many gamblers believe that after a string of losses, they are “due” for a win. Consider a gambler who repeatedly bets on reds in roulette, an event with probability $\\frac{18}{38} \\approx 0.474$. The ball has not landed in a red pocket on any of the last 4 spins of the wheel. Does this make it more likely that he will win on the next spin?\n",
