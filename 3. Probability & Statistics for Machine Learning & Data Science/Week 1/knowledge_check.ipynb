    "    - There is no way to get 1 without getting an odd number, so the or statement is redundant. As a Venn diagram, Pr(1) is completely inside the Pr(odd number) set\n",

    "5. A factory produces two types of products: Type A and Type B. It is known that 70% of the total products are Type A, while the remaining 30% are Type B. The factory has a quality control system that can correctly identify Type A products with a probability of 80% and Type B products with a probability of 90%. If a randomly selected product is tested and found to be of high quality, what is the probability that it is Type A?\n",
    "    - The question is not phrased very well, but I'm going to assume that the QC system correctly identifies **high quality** type A products 80% of the time, and **high quality** type B products 90% of the time\n",
