Calculate $E[max(X,Y)]$, the expected value of the larger of the two numbers. There are several ways you can do this. You should try to do this by applying 2D LOTUS to the joint distribution of X and Y, which is extremely simple. To check your answer, you can use the p.m.f. of $L = max(X,Y)$ that you derived in Lesson 19."
