    "- Most people guess that they would have to wait about 5 minutes, since usually you will show up at the bus stop in between bus arrivals. Surprisingly, the answer is that you have to wait just as long as if you had arrived right when the previous bus was leaving! We will see why at the end of this lesson."

    "\n",
    "    - We know from Theorem 35.2 that the time X, between when the previous bus arrived and when the next bus will arrive, follows an $\\text{Exponential}(\\lambda = 0.1)$ distribution. However, you showed up at the bus stop some time $s$ after the previous bus had left, so you should not have to wait as long as $X$.\n",

    "        - In an earlier chapter, we also noted that a Poisson distribution over a time interval can be seen as infinitely many infinitesimally small Bernoulli draws. So in every time period, there is a large chance of no arrivals, and a small chance of 1 arrival, and no chance of anything more.\n",
    "        - From this \"multiple Bernoulli draws\" perspective, waiting time for the next bus after arriving at the bus stop is basically the same as asking \"what is the probability of getting a heads in a fair coin flip, if I know that the last 10 flips were tails?\"\n",
    "        - Since each time period is independent, whether you arrive immediately after a \"heads\" (i.e. after a bus arrived) or a long time after a \"heads\" (i.e. a long time since no bus arrives), is irrelevant. "
