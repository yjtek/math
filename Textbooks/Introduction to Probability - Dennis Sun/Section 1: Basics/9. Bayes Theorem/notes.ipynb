    "    - We want to compute conditional probability $Pr(A|B)$\n",
    "    - Let's break down the conditional probability as a venn diagram, with A and B as intersecting circles\n",
    "        - In the Venn diagram, $Pr(A|B)$ is simply the intersection of A and B, divided by the area of B\n",
    "        - Intuitively, since you are already \"given\" that B has occurred, your probability space should only include the area with B. That is, $P(B)$\n",
    "        - Hence, $Pr(A|B)$ is simply the area where both A and B occurs (i.e. $Pr(A,B)$) as a proportion where area B occurs $Pr(B)$\n",

    "        - We also know from the argument above that $Pr(A|B) = \\frac{Pr(A,B)}{Pr(B)}$\n",
    "        - By symmetry, this must also mean that $Pr(B|A) = \\frac{Pr(A,B)}{Pr(A)}$\n",

    "    - We want to know, what is $Pr(A_1 | B)$\n",
    "    - Let's further suppose that $Pr(B | A_1)$, $Pr(B | A_2)$, and $Pr(B | A_3)$ are known\n",
    "    - In such a case, given that A **must** be either $A_1$, $A_2$, or $A_3$\n",
    "        - $Pr(A_1) + Pr(A_2) + Pr(A_3) = 1$\n",
    "        - $Pr(B | A_1) * Pr(A_1) + Pr(B | A_2) * Pr(A_2) + Pr(B | A_3) * Pr(A_3) = Pr(B)$\n",
    "        - $B$ must occur with $A_1$, $A_2$, or $A_3$, so summing the weighted probabilities that $B$ occurs conditioning on each value of $A$ must give you the probability of $B$. See section 8 notes, law of total probability\n",
    "    - $Pr(A_1 | B)$ must occur when both $A_1$ and $B$ occur as a percentage of the probability of $B$ occurring\n",
    "    - So this is simply $\\frac{Pr(B | A_1) * Pr(A_1)}{Pr(B | A_1) * Pr(A_1) + Pr(B | A_2) * Pr(A_2) + Pr(B | A_3) * Pr(A_3)} = \\frac{Pr(B | A_1) * Pr(A_1)}{P(B)}$\n",
