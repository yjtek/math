    "1. Each year, as part of a “Secret Santa” tradition, a group of 4 friends write their names on slips of papers and place the slips into a hat. Each member of the group draws a name at random from the hat and must by a gift for that person. Of course, it is possible that they draw their own name, in which case they buy a gift for themselves. What is the probability that everyone in the group ends up buying a gift for themselves? (Note that the names are not placed back in the hat once they are drawn, so each person receives exactly one gift.)\n",

    "4. The “bootstrap” is a statistical method for generating a new data set that is like an existing one. Suppose we have a data set consisting of 6 observations: $[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6]$ . To generate a “bootstrap” data set, we sample from the original data set with replacement, meaning that it is possible for each observation to be sampled more than once. Examples of bootstrap data sets include:\n",
